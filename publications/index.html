    <p>The main goal of this work is to present human occlusion handling behavior by mechanism design through an algorithm called Real-time leader finder (Releaf). To ensure occlusion handling, Releaf considers high costs for full and partial occlusion conditions. This algorithm is based on backward induction method in game theory. Releaf finds Nash equilibrium for a game tree and assigns leader and follower to the players of the game. This procedure coordinates camera movements with one camera (the leader) that results in occlusion handling in a multi-camera system. To evaluate our work, it is implemented on a tendon-driven 3D-printed Eye robot that tracks the face of a human-subject. Results indicate that implementation of this work enables Eye robot to handle occlusion in real-time by alternating the leader eye based on the occlusion condition.</p>

    <p>The main goal of this paper is to omit/optimize redundant rotations for Un-
manned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is a quadrotor with two-degrees of freedom
(yaw and pitch) and mounted camera in a target tracking scenario. Toward
this end, this paper considers UAV and camera as rational agents in a game
and proposes two game theoretical algorithms for selection of rotations. The
first algorithm uses backward induction to allocate rotation only to one agent;
The second algorithm leverages Nash equilibrium to select optimal degrees for
rotation of both agents. To evaluate these algorithms they are implemented on
realistic video of a zigzag moving car captured from above that replicates re-
ceiving pictures of a car by a UAV in MATLAB environment. We also propose
autonomous vision-based Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for
both UAV and camera to track the car. Simulation results show that in com-
parison to redundant rotations of both agents proposed algorithms improve PID
controller performance and decrease rotations for the agents that means lower
level of energy consumption for the system.</p>

    <p>To obtain quality pictures of a target by UAV, people face the challenge of simultaneous control for two separate items (UAV and camera). The first solution for this challenge is operating the UAV by two persons: one for control of UAV and the other for control of the camera. Due to the possibility of manual control error, this solution aggravates the situation. This paper proposes a vision based controller for target tracking that is optimized by game theory. We propose two algorithms that use backward induction and Nash equilibrium concepts in game theory. To select one of the two players for movement or to improve their decision making by considering the other players decision. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation in MATLAB and comparison to former contributions.</p>

    <p>Robotic eyes imitate human eye appearance, but,
they lack human-like movements. Also, there are no criteria to
select one eye as the leader in eyes simultaneous movement.
To solve these challenges, this paper proposes two algorithms
to coordinate the movement of two separately controlled eyes,
and, to select the leader eye in their synchronous movement.
In the first algorithm—called Gazist—eyes apply the concept
of bi-matrix games in noncooperative game theory to decide
between their vertical and horizontal options. In the second
algorithm—called Leaf —we consider game trees for sequential
eye movements. Nash equilibrium for each game tree (found by
backward induction) is our proposed criteria to choose the leader
eye.
Our algorithms are validated through experiments on a 3D
printed eye robot that tracks the face for a person walking before
it. To the best of our knowledge, Gazist algorithm constitutes one
of the first examples of coordinated movement for robotic eyes
by game theory. Also, Leaf algorithm proposes the first criteria
for choosing the leader in eyes synchronous movement.</p>

    <p>Mechanical models of the human eye, ignore one of its features. These features include
appearance, movement and actuation. To face all of these challenges, this paper proposes
a 3D design method with the aid of computer for an eye robot. The proposed robot not
only resembles human eye, but also uses tendon driven muscles for actuation, that helps
robot move in a more natural manner. Our proposed design uses the least number of
servos for actuation—one for each agonist-antagonist pair of muscles. We also propose
a vision based controller for our robot to evaluate it in MATLAB environment. This
controller provided the opportunity to devise experiments for simulation of rectus muscles
movement by this robot.</p>
