This was my idea for my MSc thesis: 

> When we have two agents (UAV and mounted camera) with similar goals in target tracking. What happens if we consider them as rational agents who make decision about their rotational degrees based on game theory?
>

At first I needed a video similar to the one received by the UAV from above. To capture such videos, I borrowed my fathers car to drive in a remote road. With these videos we were able to evaluate my idea with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aVO0KwRWkw" target="blank">MATLAB simulation</a>.
