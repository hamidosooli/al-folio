I defended my Master of Science Thesis titled "An Integrated Control Algorithm for Camera and Flying Object Movement on the Basis of Game Theory" in Aerospace Engineering (Flight Dynamics and Control). An abstract of my work is provided below, you can also see the video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aVO0KwRWkw" target="blank">my simulations</a>.

To obtain quality pictures of a target by UAV, people face the challenge of simultaneous control for two separate items (UAV and camera). The first solution for this challenge is operating the UAV by two persons: one for control of UAV and the other for control of the camera. Due to the possibility of manual control error, this solution aggravates the situation. This paper proposes a vision based controller for target tracking that is optimized by game theory. We propose two algorithms that use backward induction and Nash equilibrium concepts in game theory. To select one of the two players for movement or to improve their decision making by considering the other players decision. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation in MATLAB and comparison to former contributions.
