I'm a graduate researcher with the [Aerospace Engineering Department](http://en.aero.kntu.ac.ir/){:target="\_blank"} at [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://www.kntu.ac.ir/Index.aspx?lang=2&sub=0){:target="\_blank"}. I defended my M. Sc. thesis in Flight Dynamics and Control under the supervision of [Prof. Roshanian](https://wp.kntu.ac.ir/roshanian/){:target="\_blank"} as the first one among all the incoming Aerospace Engineering students in Fall 2017. I have also completed my B.Sc. studies at [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://mechanic.kashanu.ac.ir/en){:target="\_blank"} in [University of Kashan](https://kashanu.ac.ir/en){:target="\_blank"} and finished my B. Sc. Project under the supervision of [Dr. Irani Rahaghi](https://faculty.kashanu.ac.ir/irani/en){:target="\_blank"}.

I started my B.Sc. studies at [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.iut.ac.ir/en){:target="\_blank"} in [Isfahan University of Technology](http://iut.ac.ir/en){:target="\_blank"}, where I studied Information Technology Engineering. It was a great experience as I learned how to use computer and programming in solving real-life problems ([cardice game](https://github.com/hamidosooli/cardice-game){:target="\_blank"} is a memento of that time). However, after four semesters it was going to create a management atmosphere instead of an engineering perspective. This was in stark contrast to my academic goals. Although I was in midway for graduation and a change would cause me to go back to square one as well as facing many hardships (e.g. severe schedule conflicts), I decided to pursue my studies in Mechanical Engineering. Where I could develop a deep interest in Robotics and Control. Besides my scientific life I have had an athletic life from my childhood.
